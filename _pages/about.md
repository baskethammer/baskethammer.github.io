This is a place for me to document things that needed googling while attempting
various homelab or software projects to scratch my own itches.  My last
professional experiences as a sysadmin were in the 90's, and I left tech
entirely in the early aughts.

To the extent I write at all about policy or politics, it will be focused on
"how things actually work", not my preferred positions or candidates.
