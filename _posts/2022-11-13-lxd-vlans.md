I'm old and scared of NetworkManager, so when installing the primary server
on my home network the newer methods of network configuration were axed, and
/etc/network/interfaces reinstated to its former glory.  Since every bit of
kit was on the same subnet, it made sense to just create a bridge on a fixed
ip, then start up the lxd containers on the bridge and let them go on their
merry way.

Of course now that I have the brocade, I need to split the containers by
vlan to be available for all users (plex), non-guest users (samba) and just
me (linux iso downloading apps).  Initial googling suggested a whole bunch
of new vlan interfaces, and bridges on each, which seemed dumb.  Deeper
googling suggested that vlan-aware bridges are a thing, and
VLANFiltering=true is probably the magic incantation.

To be clear, I want one bridge with access to several bridged vlans. I do
not want to create a bunch of individual vlans and bridges.

Further sleuthing reveals a crossroads-  one can either migrate from ifupdown
to ifupdown2, which has drop-in bridging for this use case, or go back to
native ubuntu tools (NetworkManager [gah!] or systemd-networkd.  I choose
the latter for no reason but it would be fun to rename the interfaces by
physical location [top, bottom, etc, but 'test0' for this exercise]).


This [helpful
discussion](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-containers-on-a-vlan-aware-bridge/14734/2)
 isn't quite enough to infer the correct incantations without
bonding multiple interfaces, but the man pages for [systemd.link](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.link.html),
[systemd.netdev](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.netdev.html),
and
[systemd.network](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.netdev.html)
can get us sorted.  Briefly:

1.  Our 10-testlan.link file looks like this:
```yaml
[Match]
#OriginalName=enp3s0
MACAddress=a8:a1:59:3f:b2:7b
[Link]
Description="Middle Port"
Name=test0
```
Lets ahve some more text there.
2. is this indented
```yaml
[Match]
Name=test0
[Network]
Bridge=tbr0
[BridgeVLAN]
VLAN=2-4094
```
